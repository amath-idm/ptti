Results of running models for testing and contact tracing. The model is in 
the file `policies.ka'.

For each scenario or case, the model was run 24 times.

Individual trajectories are in the `trajectories' directory and are named
`lmic-case-N-X.dat' where N is the case number and X is the trajectory.

These individual trajectories are combined using the python script 
`combine.py' to create `lmic-case-N-avg.tsv' and `lmic-case-N-std.tsv'
with the average and standard deviation of the trajectories respectively.

The cases are listed in the `lmic-cases.tsv' file. It is generated by the
`cases.py' python script.

There are plots of each case individually as PNG files and in one big
PDF, `lmic-cases.pdf'.
