## Initial values for the simulation
initial:
  ## N is the total population
  N:    67886011    # mid-year 2020 from: https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/uk-population/
  ## IU is the number of unconfined, infected individuals
  IU:   2

## Parameters of the simulation.
## All rates are per individual per day.
parameters:
  ## beta is the infectiousness of the disease, the
  ## probability of infecting a contact.
  beta:  0.033

  ## c is the contact rate per day. 13 is an accepted
  ## value on average under normal circumstances.
  c:     13.0

  ## alpha is the rate at which exposed individuals
  ## (infected but not infectious) become infectious. 
  ## 5 day incubation period
  alpha: 0.2

  ## gamma is the rate at which individuals either 
  ## recover, or are taken into hospital and assumed
  ## to be isolated. One week.
  gamma: 0.1429

  ## kappa is the rate at which individuals leave
  ## isolation. This is one week according to UK policy.
  ## The WHO thinks it should be 0.0714 (14 days).
  ## We agree with WHO and think isolation should last for 14 symptom free days
  kappa: 0.0714

  ## theta governs testing, and we start with none
  theta: 0.0

  ## chi is the rate at which contacts are traced.
  ## Tracing is triggered by testing. Starts at none.
  chi:   0.0

  ## eta is the success rate of tracing. Starts at none
  eta:   0.0

## Exogenous interventions. The time is given in
## simulation days.
interventions:
  ## After three months, start of restrictions on 16th March. 
  ## Reduce contacts from 10 to 13 per day (by ~25%).
  - time: 89    # 16th March 2020 (assume seeding on 18th December 2019)
    parameters:
      c: 10
  ## After one more week, Lockdown, on 23rd March. 
  ## Reduce contacts to 4 per day (~70% reduction).
  - time: 96    # 23rd March 2020 (assume seeding on 18th December 2019)
    parameters:
      c: 4
  
  ## On 18th May, start contact tracing, 
  ##  start cloth face covering (mask) wearing in public
  - time: 152
    parameters:
      theta: 100000/N   # 100,000 people tested per day in the UK
      chi: 0.8  # 80% of the ~3000 cases per day (1% of tested) have contacts traced
                # 18,000 contact tracers starting on this date should be able to
                #   trace 'all' (eta) contacts in one day in teams of 6 for each case
      eta: 0.8  # 80% of contacts for each case successfully traced by contact tracers, 
                #   with support from mobile phone apps
      beta: 0.0231  # 30% reduction in Beta due to pulic wearing of home-made cloth face coverings 
                    # conservative assumption based on DELVE 4th May review

  ## On 1st June, scale up testing, and contact tracing
  - time: 166
    parameters:
      theta: 300000/N   # 300,000 people tested per day in the UK
      chi: 0.8  # 80% of the ~6000 cases per day (2% of tested) have contacts traced
                # 36,000 contact tracers starting on this date should be able to
                #   trace 'all' (eta) contacts in one day in teams of 6 for each case
      eta: 0.8  # 80% of contacts for each case successfully traced by contact tracers, 
                #   with support from mobile phone apps
                
  ## On 29th June, scale up testing, and contact tracing further
  - time: 194
    parameters:
      theta: 900000/N   # 900,000 people tested per day in the UK
      chi: 0.8  # 80% of the ~9000 cases per day (1% of tested) have contacts traced
                # 54,000 contact tracers starting on this date should be able to
                #   trace 'all' (eta) contacts in one day in teams of 6 for each case
      eta: 0.8  # 80% of contacts for each case successfully traced by contact tracers, 
                #   with support from mobile phone apps
                
  ## On 27th July, scale up testing, and contact tracing further still
  - time: 222
    parameters:
      theta: 3000000/N   # 3,000,000 people tested per day in the UK
      chi: 0.8  # 80% of the ~11667 cases per day (0.39% of tested) have contacts traced
                # 70,000 contact tracers starting on this date should be able to
                #   trace 'all' (eta) contacts in one day in teams of 6 for each case
      eta: 0.8  # 80% of contacts for each case successfully traced by contact tracers, 
                #   with support from mobile phone apps
                
  ## On 31st August, scale up testing, and contact tracing to maximum
  - time: 257
    parameters:
      theta: 9000000/N   # 9,000,000 people tested per day in the UK (
