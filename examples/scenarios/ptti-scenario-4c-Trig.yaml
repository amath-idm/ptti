## This is Scenario 4c Trig: Clinical case identification: As scenarios 3a with face coverings (reduce Beta 
##    -transmission per contact- by 30%). Otherwise as per scenario 2a but with targetted testing 
##  from pool of those identified clinically (by bespoke clinical reporting system) as per 'Numbers T & T' sheet of Test calcs sheets: 
##  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/136_sukzkrMrjtpRccAmoUoXn8Ue4GGUY3RRj4VWj7LU/edit?usp=sharing 
##  with 80% of contacts traced per case (all on one day). Remain in Lockdown (i.e. continue 
##  lockdown from 23rd March) while testing, tracing and isolation scaled up. Then:
##    Lockdown released when there are less than 20,000 cases per day
##    Lockdown triggered when there are more than 40,000 cases per day

  start: 2019/12/18

  steps: 895

## Initial values for the simulation
initial:
  ## N is the total population
  N:    67886011    # mid-year 2020 from: https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/uk-population/
  ## IU is the number of unconfined, infected individuals
  IU:   2

## Parameters of the simulation.
## All rates are per individual per day.
parameters:
  ## beta is the infectiousness of the disease, the
  ## probability of infecting a contact.
  beta: 0.0425   # was 0.036 based on ptti fitting but scaled by 13/11 given change in
                 # baseline c from 13 to 11 (beta has to increase to compensate and get the same fit)

  ## c0 is contacts per day at baseline, pre-pandemic
  c0: 11   # baseline pre-pandemic (ref Polymod, UK only, & BBC Pandemic)

  ## alpha is the rate at which exposed individuals
  ## (infected but not infectious) become infectious. 
  ## 5 day incubation period
  alpha: 0.2

  ## gamma is the rate at which individuals either 
  ## recover, or are taken into hospital and assumed
  ## to be isolated. One week.
  gamma: 0.1429

  ## kappa is the rate at which individuals leave
  ## isolation. This is one week according to UK policy.
  ## The WHO thinks it should be 0.0714 (14 days).
  ## We agree with WHO and think isolation should last for 14 symptom free days
  kappa: 0.0714

  ## chi is the rate at which contacts are traced.
  ## Tracing is triggered by testing. Starts at none.
  chi:   0.0

  ## eta is the success rate of tracing. Starts at none
  eta:   0.0
  
  ## below parameters are used in calculation of theta below

  ## testedBase is the rate of background random testing in the population
  testedBase: 0.0
  ## default testing rate (proportion of symptomatics)
  tested: 0.8   
  ## 50% of SARS-Cov-2 infected (IU) have symptoms
  symptomatic: 0.5 
  ## average duration of symptomatic illness(coldflu or Covid combined)
  duration: 7
  
  ## theta governs testing, and we start with none
  theta: 0.0

## simulation days.

       ## Tracing

                #   trace 'all' (eta) contacts in one day in teams of 6 for each case
      eta: 0.8  # 80% of contacts for each case successfully traced by contact tracers,
