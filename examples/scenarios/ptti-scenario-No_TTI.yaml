##
## This is Scenario No TTI: No testing, tracing and isolation.
##   Lockdown lifted in a phased way as per UK government Covid-19 recovery strategy (11th May): 
##   those who canâ€™t work from home encouraged back to work from 13th May, some schools 
##   open in June, some entertainment venues open in July

## Initial values for the simulation
initial:
  ## N is the total population
  N:    67886011    # mid-year 2020 from: https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/uk-population/
  ## IU is the number of unconfined, infected individuals
  IU:   2

## Parameters of the simulation.
## All rates are per individual per day.
parameters:
  ## beta is the infectiousness of the disease, the
  ## probability of infecting a contact.
  beta: 0.039   # based on model fitting

  ## c0 is contacts per day at baseline, pre-pandemic
  c0: 11   # baseline pre-pandemic (ref Polymod, UK only, & BBC Pandemic)
  c: c0

  ## alpha is the rate at which exposed individuals
  ## (infected but not infectious) become infectious. 
  ## 5 day incubation period
  alpha: 0.2

  ## gamma is the rate at which individuals either 
  ## recover, or are taken into hospital and assumed
  ## to be isolated. One week.
  gamma: 0.1429

  ## kappa is the rate at which individuals leave
  ## isolation. This is one week according to UK policy.
  ## The WHO thinks it should be 0.0714 (14 days).
  ## We agree with WHO and think isolation should last for 14 symptom free days
  kappa: 0.0714

  ## testedBase is the rate of testing at random in the population
  testedBase: 0.0

  ## theta governs testing, and we start with none
  theta: 0.0

  ## chi is the rate at which contacts are traced.
  ## Tracing is triggered by testing. Starts at none.
  chi:   0.0

  ## eta is the success rate of tracing. Starts at none
  eta:   0.0

## Exogenous interventions. The time is given in
## simulation days.
interventions:
  ## After three months, start of restrictions on 16th March. 
  ## Reduce contacts by 30%.
  - time: 89    # 16th March 2020 (assume seeding on 18th December 2019)
    parameters:
      c: c0 * 0.7
  ## After one more week, Lockdown, on 23rd March.
  ## Reduce contacts to ~3 per day (~70% reduction).
  - time: 96    # 23rd March 2020 (assume seeding on 18th December 2019)
    parameters:
      c: c0 * 0.3 # Lockdown, Jarvis et al 2020: ~70% reduction in contacts
  
  ## 9th June, contacts per day only slightly increased according to CoMix data:
  - time: 174
    parameters:
      c: c0 * 0.4 # CoMix Weekly report 11 (LSHTM) shows contacts only increased from
                  # 2.6 under lockdown to 3.8 week of 5th-12th June

  ## On 4th July, pubs and entertainment venues open with 1m distancing rule
  - time: 199
    parameters:
      c: c0 * 0.6 # Contacts per day increase

  ## On 31st July, contacts increase a bit more
  - time: 226
     parameters:
      c: c0 * 0.7 # Contacts per day increase

  ## On 31st August, contacts increase a bit more
  - time: 257
    parameters:
      c: c0 * 0.8 # Contacts per day increase
                  # assume contacts per day won't go back up to pre-pandemic level of 11
