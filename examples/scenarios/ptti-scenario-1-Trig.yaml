## This is Scenario 1 Trig: Tiggered lockdown release, no testing and tracing
##    Lockdown released when there are less than 20,000 cases per day
##    Lockdown triggered when there are more than 40,000 cases per day

## Initial values for the simulation
initial:
  ## N is the total population
  N:    67886011    # mid-year 2020 from: https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/uk-population/
  ## IU is the number of unconfined, infected individuals
  IU:   2

## Parameters of the simulation.
## All rates are per individual per day.
parameters:
  ## beta is the infectiousness of the disease, the
  ## probability of infecting a contact.
  beta:  0.036   # this based on ptti-fit fitting

  ## c is the contact rate per day. 13 is an accepted
  ## value on average under normal circumstances.
  c:     13.0

  ## alpha is the rate at which exposed individuals
  ## (infected but not infectious) become infectious. 
  ## 5 day incubation period
  alpha: 0.2

  ## gamma is the rate at which individuals either 
  ## recover, or are taken into hospital and assumed
  ## to be isolated. One week.
  gamma: 0.1429

  ## kappa is the rate at which individuals leave
  ## isolation. This is one week according to UK policy.
  ## The WHO thinks it should be 0.0714 (14 days).
  ## We agree with WHO and think isolation should last for 14 symptom free days
  kappa: 0.0714

  ## rate of testing at random in the general population
  testedBase: 0.0
  ## theta governs testing, and we start with none
  theta: 0.0

  ## chi is the rate at which contacts are traced.
  ## Tracing is triggered by testing. Starts at none.
  chi:   0.0

  ## eta is the success rate of tracing. Starts at none
  eta:   0.0

## Exogenous interventions. The time is given in
## simulation days.
interventions:
  ## After three months, start of restrictions on 16th March. 
  ## Reduce contacts from 10 to 13 per day (by ~25%).
  - time: 89    # 16th March 2020 (assume seeding on 18th December 2019)
    parameters:
      c: 10
  ## After one more week, Lockdown, on 23rd March. 
  ## Reduce contacts to 4 per day (~70% reduction).
  - time: 96    # 23rd March 2020 (assume seeding on 18th December 2019)
    parameters:
      c: 4
  
## Release lockdown gradually when below 20k cases
  - condition: x[IU] + x[ID] - 20000
    after: 96
    direction: -1.0
    parameters:
      c: 8
      locked: False
## Lockdown trigger on 40k cases
  - condition: x[IU] + x[ID] - 40000
    after: 96
    direction: 1.0
    parameters:
      c: 3.9
      locked: True
