##
## This is Scenario 1: Phased lockdown release, no testing and tracing. 
##   Lockdown lifted in a phased way as per UK government Covid-19 recovery strategy (11th May): 
##   those who can’t work from home encouraged back to work from 13th May, some schools 
##   may open 1st June, some entertainment venues may open 4th July 
##   (the latter both subject to estimates of infections circulating and R)

  title: PTTI Scenario 1
  output: ptti-scenario-1-out
  start: 2019/12/18
  envelope: false
  tmax: 895
  steps: 895

## Initial values for the simulation
initial:
  ## N is the total population
  N:    67886011    # mid-year 2020 from: https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/uk-population/
  ## IU is the number of unconfined, infected individuals
  IU:   2

## Parameters of the simulation.
## All rates are per individual per day.
parameters:
  ## beta is the infectiousness of the disease, the
  ## probability of infecting a contact.
  beta: 0.0425   # was 0.036 based on ptti fitting but scaled by 13/11 given change in
                 # baseline c from 13 to 11 (beta has to increase to compensate and get the same fit)

  ## c0 is contacts per day at baseline, pre-pandemic
  c0: 11   # baseline pre-pandemic (ref Polymod, UK only, & BBC Pandemic)
  c: c0

  ## alpha is the rate at which exposed individuals
  ## (infected but not infectious) become infectious. 
  ## 5 day incubation period
  alpha: 0.2

  ## gamma is the rate at which individuals either 
  ## recover, or are taken into hospital and assumed
  ## to be isolated. One week.
  gamma: 0.1429

  ## kappa is the rate at which individuals leave
  ## isolation. This is one week according to UK policy.
  ## The WHO thinks it should be 0.0714 (14 days).
  ## We agree with WHO and think isolation should last for 14 symptom free days
  kappa: 0.0714

  ## testedBase is the rate of testing at random in the population
  testedBase: 0.0

  ## theta governs testing, and we start with none
  theta: 0.0

  ## chi is the rate at which contacts are traced.
  ## Tracing is triggered by testing. Starts at none.
  chi:   0.0

  ## eta is the success rate of tracing. Starts at none
  eta:   0.0

## Exogenous interventions. The time is given in
## simulation days.
interventions:
  ## After three months, start of restrictions on 16th March. 
  ## Reduce contacts by 30%.
  - time: 89    # 16th March 2020 (assume seeding on 18th December 2019)
    parameters:
      c: c0 * 0.7
  ## After one more week, Lockdown, on 23rd March.
  ## Reduce contacts to ~3 per day (~70% reduction).
  - time: 96    # 23rd March 2020 (assume seeding on 18th December 2019)
    parameters:
      c: c0 * 0.3 # Lockdown, Jarvis et al 2020: ~70% reduction in contacts
  
  ## On 13th May, start relax lockdown, phase one: 
  ##    those who can’t work from home encouraged back to work 
  - time: 147
    parameters:
      c: c0 * 0.4 # CoMix Weekly report 9 (LSHTM) shows contacts only increased from
                  # 2.6 under lockdown to 3.5 week of 21-28th May

  ## On 1st June, relax lockdown more, phase two
  ##  some schools may open 1st June
  - time: 166
    parameters:
      c: c0 * 0.6    # Contacts per day increase from 4.4 to 6.6
      
  ## On 4th July, relax lockdown more, phase three
  ##  some entertainment venues may open
  - time: 199
    parameters:
      c: c0 * 0.8 # Contacts per day increse from 6.6 to 8.8
                  # assume contacts per day won't go back up to pre-pandemic level of 11
periods:
  - 2021/05/31
  - 2022/05/31
