##   Targeted PTTI Lockdown Triggers: Clinical case identification: As Untargeted PTTI but with targeted testing
##    from pool of those identified clinically (by bespoke clinical reporting system) as per 'Numbers T & T' sheet of Test calcs sheets: 
##    https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/136_sukzkrMrjtpRccAmoUoXn8Ue4GGUY3RRj4VWj7LU/edit?usp=sharing 
##    with 80% of contacts traced per case (all on one day).
##    From 31st July: Lockdown released when there are less than 10,000 cases per day
##    Lockdown triggered when there are more than 40,000 cases per day

## Initial values for the simulation
initial:
  ## N is the total population
  N:    67886011    # mid-year 2020 from: https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/uk-population/
  ## IU is the number of unconfined, infected individuals
  IU:   2

## Parameters of the simulation.
## All rates are per individual per day.
parameters:
  ## beta is the infectiousness of the disease, the
  ## probability of infecting a contact.
  beta: 0.0588   # changed because of higher gamma (5 days rather than 7 days) to get same R0: beta=0.042*7/5

  ## c0 is contacts per day at baseline, pre-pandemic
  c0: 11   # baseline pre-pandemic (ref Polymod, UK only, & BBC Pandemic)
  c: c0

  ## alpha is the rate at which exposed individuals
  ## (infected but not infectious) become infectious.
  ## 5 day incubation period
  alpha: 0.2

  ## gamma is the rate at which individuals either
  ## recover, or are taken into hospital and assumed
  ## to be isolated. 5 days
  gamma: 0.2

  ## kappa is the rate at which individuals leave
  ## isolation. This is one week according to UK policy.
  ## The WHO thinks it should be 0.0714 (14 days).
  ## We agree with WHO and think isolation should last for 14 symptom free days
  kappa: 0.0714

  ## chi is the rate at which contacts are traced.
  ## Tracing is triggered by testing. Starts at none.
  chi:   0.0

  ## eta is the success rate of tracing. Starts at none
  eta:   0.0

  ## below parameters are used in calculation of theta below

  ## rate of testing at random in the general population
  testedBase: 0.0

  ## default testing rate (proportion of symptomatics)
  tested: 0.8   
  ## 50% of SARS-Cov-2 infected (IU) have symptoms
  symptomatic: 0.5 
  ## average duration of symptomatic illness(coldflu or Covid combined)
  duration: 7
  ## theta governs testing, and we start with none
  theta: 0.0
  
## Exogenous interventions. The time is given in
## simulation days.

      testedBase: coldflu*tested/duration
      thetaI: symptomatic*tested/duration

      ## Tracing
