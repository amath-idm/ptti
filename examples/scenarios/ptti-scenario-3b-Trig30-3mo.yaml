##
## This is Scenario 19 same as scenario 3b-Trig but with testing everyone every week with reduced tracing success to a level
##  that doesn't work with targeted testing (eta=0.3)
##  Scaled down to targeted testing after 3 months at full capacity to save costs
## : Cloth face coverings (masks) added starting 18th May
## (reduce Beta -transmission per contact- by 30%). Otherwise as per scenario 2b Trig

## Initial values for the simulation
initial:
  ## N is the total population
  N:    67886011    # mid-year 2020 from: https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/uk-population/
  ## IU is the number of unconfined, infected individuals
  IU:   2

## Parameters of the simulation.
## All rates are per individual per day.
parameters:
  ## beta is the infectiousness of the disease, the
  ## probability of infecting a contact.
  beta: 0.0425   # was 0.036 based on ptti fitting but scaled by 13/11 given change in
                 # baseline c from 13 to 11 (beta has to increase to compensate and get the same fit)

  ## c0 is contacts per day at baseline, pre-pandemic
  c0: 11   # baseline pre-pandemic (ref Polymod, UK only, & BBC Pandemic)
  c: c0

  ## alpha is the rate at which exposed individuals
  ## (infected but not infectious) become infectious.
  ## 5 day incubation period
  alpha: 0.2

  ## gamma is the rate at which individuals either
  ## recover, or are taken into hospital and assumed
  ## to be isolated. One week.
  gamma: 0.1429

  ## kappa is the rate at which individuals leave
  ## isolation. This is one week according to UK policy.
  ## The WHO thinks it should be 0.0714 (14 days).
  ## We agree with WHO and think isolation should last for 14 symptom free days
  kappa: 0.0714

  ## rate of testing at random in the general population
  testedBase: 0.0

  ## theta governs testing, and we start with none
  theta: 0.0

  ## chi is the rate at which contacts are traced.
  ## Tracing is triggered by testing. Starts at none.
  chi:   0.0

  ## eta is the success rate of tracing. Starts at none
  eta:   0.0

  ## duration of illness, used in calculations below
  duration: 7
  symptomatic: 0.5

## simulation days.
