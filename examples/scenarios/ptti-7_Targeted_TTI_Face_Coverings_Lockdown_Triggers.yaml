## Initial values for the simulation
initial:
  ## N is the total population
  N:    67886011    # mid-year 2020 from: https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/uk-population/
  ## IU is the number of unconfined, infected individuals
  IU:   2

## Parameters of the simulation.
## All rates are per individual per day.
parameters:
  ## beta is the infectiousness of the disease, the
  ## probability of infecting a contact.
  beta: 0.0435   # based on model fitting, c=3 during lockdown as per Jarvis et al 2020: "We found a 74% reduction in
                # the average daily number of contactsobserved per participant (from 10.8 to 2.8). We round these to 11 and 3

  ## c0 is contacts per day at baseline, pre-pandemic
  c0: 11   # baseline pre-pandemic (ref Polymod, UK only, & BBC Pandemic)
  c: c0

  ## alpha is the rate at which exposed individuals
  ## (infected but not infectious) become infectious.
  ## 5 day incubation period
  alpha: 0.2

  ## gamma is the rate at which individuals either
  ## recover, or are taken into hospital and assumed
  ## to be isolated. One Week.
  gamma: 0.1429

  ## kappa is the rate at which individuals leave
  ## isolation. This is one week according to UK policy.
  ## The WHO thinks it should be 0.0714 (14 days).
  ## We agree with WHO and think isolation should last for 14 symptom free days
  kappa: 0.0714

  ## chi is the rate at which contacts are traced.
  ## Tracing is triggered by testing. Starts at none.
  chi:   0.0

  ## eta is the success rate of tracing. Starts at none
  eta:   0.0

  ## below parameters are used in calculation of theta below

  ## rate of testing at random in the general population
  testedBase: 0.0

  tested: 0.8   
  ## 50% of SARS-Cov-2 infected (IU) have symptoms
  symptomatic: 0.5

  ## After three months, start of restrictions on 16th March.
