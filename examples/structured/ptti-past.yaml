## Initial values for the simulation
initial:
  ## N is the total population
  N:    67886011    # mid-year 2020 from: https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/uk-population/
  ## IU is the number of unconfined, infected individuals
  IU:   1

## Parameters of the simulation.
## All rates are per individual per day.
parameters:
  ## beta is the infectiousness of the disease, the
  ## probability of infecting a contact.
  beta: 0.0435
  ## c0 is contacts per day at baseline, pre-pandemic
  c0: 11   # baseline pre-pandemic (ref Polymod, UK only, & BBC Pandemic)
  c: c0
  ifr: 0.0068

  ## alpha is the rate at which exposed individuals
  ## (infected but not infectious) become infectious. 
  ## 5 day incubation period
  alpha: 0.2

  ## gamma is the rate at which individuals either 
  ## recover, or are taken into hospital and assumed
  ## to be isolated. One week.
  gamma: 0.1429

  ## kappa is the rate at which individuals leave
  ## isolation. This is one week according to UK policy.
  ## The WHO thinks it should be 0.0714 (14 days).
  ## We agree with WHO and think isolation should last for 14 symptom free days
  kappa: 0.0714

  ## testedBase is the background rate of testing
  testedBase: 0.0
  ## theta governs testing of infectious individuals, and we start with none
  theta: testedBase
  
  ## (Extra) unversal tests.
  theta_U: 0.0

  ## chi is the rate at which contacts are traced. (In fraction of contacts per case.)
  ## Tracing is triggered by testing. Starts at none.
  chi:   0.0

  ## eta is the success rate of tracing. Starts at none
  eta:   0.0

  ## scaling for targeted and universal testing
  tscale: 0.8
  uscale: 1.0

  ## default testing rate (proportion of symptomatics)
  tested: tscale
