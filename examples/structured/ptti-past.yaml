meta:
  start: 2020/02/28   # ~5000 cases estimated before 28th Feb
  envelope: false

  tmax: 895

## Initial values for the simulation
initial:
  ## N is the total population
  N:    67886011    # mid-year 2020 from: https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/uk-population/
  ## IU is the number of unconfined, infected individuals
  IU:   5000

## Parameters of the simulation.
## All rates are per individual per day.
parameters:
  ## beta is the infectiousness of the disease, the
  ## probability of infecting a contact.
  beta: 0.042
  ## c0 is contacts per day at baseline, pre-pandemic
  c0: 11   # baseline pre-pandemic (ref Polymod, UK only, & BBC Pandemic)
  c: c0

  ## alpha is the rate at which exposed individuals
  ## (infected but not infectious) become infectious. 
  ## 5 day incubation period
  alpha: 0.2

  ## gamma is the rate at which individuals either 
  ## recover, or are taken into hospital and assumed
  ## to be isolated. One week.
  gamma: 0.1429

  ## kappa is the rate at which individuals leave
  ## isolation. This is one week according to UK policy.
  ## The WHO thinks it should be 0.0714 (14 days).
  ## We agree with WHO and think isolation should last for 14 symptom free days
  kappa: 0.0714

  ## testedBase is the background rate of testing
  testedBase: 0.0
  ## theta governs testing of infectious individuals, and we start with none
  theta: testedBase

  ## chi is the rate at which contacts are traced.
  ## Tracing is triggered by testing. Starts at none.
  chi:   0.0

  ## eta is the success rate of tracing. Starts at none
  eta:   0.0

  ## default testing rate (proportion of symptomatics)
  tested: 0.8   
  ## 50% of SARS-Cov-2 infected (IU) have symptoms
  symptomatic: 0.5 
  ## average duration of symptomatic illness(coldflu or Covid combined)
  duration: 7

## Exogenous interventions. The time is given in
## simulation days.
interventions:
  ## After three months, start of restrictions on 16th March. 
  ## Reduce contacts by 30%.
  - time: 17    # 16th March 2020 (assume seeding on 18th December 2019)
    name: "Past"
    parameters:
      c: c0 * 0.7
  ## After one more week, Lockdown, on 23rd March.
  ## Reduce contacts to ~3 per day (~70% reduction).
  - time: 24    # 23rd March 2020 (assume seeding on 18th December 2019)
    name: "Past"
    parameters:
      c: c0 * 0.26 # Lockdown, Jarvis et al 2020: ~70% reduction in contacts
  
  ## 9th June, contacts per day only slightly increased according to CoMix data:
  - time: 102
    name: "Past"
    parameters:
      c: c0 * 0.35 # CoMix Weekly report 11 (LSHTM)

  - time: 127
    name: "Past"
    parameters:
      c: c0 * 0.6 # Contacts per day increase
