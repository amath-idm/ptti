  ## On 9th June, scale up testing, and contact tracing
  ## 9th June, contacts per day only slightly increased according to CoMix data:
  - time: 174
    name: "Targeted Testing"
    parameters:
      tested: 0.18       # ramp up testing to 18%
      testedBase: coldflu*tested/duration
      thetaI: symptomatic*tested/duration
      theta: testedBase + (1-testedBase)*thetaI
            ## Tracing
      chi: 0.8  #  trace 80% of the eta contacts who will be traced in one day with teams of tracers
                #
      eta: 0.47 # 47% of contacts for each case successfully traced by contact tracers,
                #  This now matches current success rates.
  ## Scale up testing, and contact tracing further
  - time: 199

    parameters:
            ## Targetted Testing
      tested: 0.4       # proportion of symptomatic who are tested (this is the same for

      testedBase: coldflu*tested/duration
      thetaI: symptomatic*tested/duration
      theta: testedBase + (1-testedBase)*thetaI
            ## Tracing - as above  

  ##  Targetted Testing - scale up tested further still (proportion of symptomatics tested during their week long illness)
