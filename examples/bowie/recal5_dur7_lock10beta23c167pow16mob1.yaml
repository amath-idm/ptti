##   Targeted TTI: Clinical case identification: As Universal PTTI but with targeted testing
##    from pool of those identified clinically (by bespoke clinical reporting system)
##      with contract tracing and isolation of positive cases
##    With Face Coverings from 24th July but at half the full effect of 15% - so 7.5%
##      alpha .25 to have latent period of 4 days, beta 0.027; symp 0.39 latest Cambridge survey
##      Co14.3 with reduction in contacts using IHME's assessment of mobility using Google calibrated
##      and a power function of 1.08 to increase effect of mobility on contacts
##      with lockdown from 14th September to mimic Rule of 6 in homes - probably reduce contacts by 10% but using scenarios to assess requirement
##      Kappa based on gov policy of 7 days till 1st August , then 10 days

## Initial values for the simulation
initial:
  ## N is the total population
  N:    67886011    # mid-year 2020 from: https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/uk-population/
  ## IU is the number of unconfined, infected individuals
  IU:   2

## Parameters of the simulation.
## All rates are per individual per day.

  ## beta is the infectiousness of the disease, the
  ## probability of infecting a contact.
  beta0: 0.023 # based on model fitting
  beta: beta0
  ## c0 is contacts per day at baseline, pre-pandemic
  c0: 16.7   # baseline pre-pandemic c: c0 calibrated to allow drop to ONS incidence levels on 12 May from peak on 31 March
  power: 1.6 #power function to modify mobility index provided by Google through IHME

  ## alpha is the rate at which exposed individuals
  ## (infected but not infectious) become infectious.
  ## 4 day latent period
  alpha: 0.25

  ## gamma is the rate at which individuals either
  ## recover, or are taken into hospital and assumed
  ## to be isolated. One Week.
  gamma: 0.1429

  ## kappa is the rate at which individuals leave
  ## isolation. This is one week according to UK policy - used here till 1st August when changed to 10 days
  ## The WHO thinks it should be 0.0714 (14 days).
  ## We agree with WHO and think isolation should last for 14 symptom free days
  kappa: 0.1429

  ## chi is the rate at which contacts are traced.
  ## Tracing is triggered by testing. Starts at none.
  chi:   0.0

  ## eta is the success rate of tracing. Starts at none
  eta:   0.0
